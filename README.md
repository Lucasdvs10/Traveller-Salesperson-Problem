# Traveller-Salesperson-Problem

I solved the Traveller Salesperson Problem using genetic algorithm in javascript.

Inspired by Daniel Shiffman - The coding train

Inspired also by Nerdologia, a brazilian channel about science and history

I made this when i was a begginer in genetic algorithms, so it is not as clean as i wanted neither as efficient as it could be, it is a bit confused to understand.

Althought all these problems I learned a lot of concepts while making this program.
